Introduced in Java 8, the Stream API is used to process collections of objects. A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
The features of Java stream are –

A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
Streams don’t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations can be pipelined. Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.
Different Operations On Streams-
Intermediate Operations:

map: The map method is used to returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream.
List number = Arrays.asList(2,3,4,5);
List square = number.stream().map(x->x*x).collect(Collectors.toList());
filter: The filter method is used to select elements as per the Predicate passed as argument.
List names = Arrays.asList("Reflection","Collection","Stream");
List result = names.stream().filter(s->s.startsWith("S")).collect(Collectors.toList());
sorted: The sorted method is used to sort the stream.
List names = Arrays.asList("Reflection","Collection","Stream");
List result = names.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.toList());


Terminal Operations:

collect: The collect method is used to return the result of the intermediate operations performed on the stream.
List number = Arrays.asList(2,3,4,5,3);
Set square = number.stream().map(x->x*x).collect(Collectors.toSet());
forEach: The forEach method is used to iterate through every element of the stream.
List number = Arrays.asList(2,3,4,5);
number.stream().map(x->x*x).forEach(y->System.out.println(y));
reduce: The reduce method is used to reduce the elements of a stream to a single value.
The reduce method takes a BinaryOperator as a parameter.
List number = Arrays.asList(2,3,4,5);
int even = number.stream().filter(x->x%2==0).reduce(0,(ans,i)-> ans+i);

Here ans variable is assigned 0 as the initial value and i is added to it .


Based on the above points, a stream is :

Not a data structure
Designed for lambdas
Do not support indexed access
Can easily be aggregated as arrays or lists
Lazy access supported
Parallelizable


Streams are created on a source, e.g. a java.util.Collection like List or Set. The Map is not supported directly, we can create stream of map keys, values or entries.
