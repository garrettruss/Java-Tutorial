JVM Memory 

Method area: In the method area, all class level information like class name, immediate parent class name, methods and variables information etc. are stored, including static variables. There is only one method area per JVM, and it is a shared resource.
Heap area: Information of all objects is stored in the heap area. There is also one Heap Area per JVM. It is also a shared resource.
Stack area: For every thread, JVM creates one run-time stack which is stored here. Every block of this stack is called activation record/stack frame which stores methods calls. All local variables of that method are stored in their corresponding frame. After a thread terminates, its run-time stack will be destroyed by JVM. It is not a shared resource.
PC Registers: Store address of current execution instruction of a thread. Obviously, each thread has separate PC Registers.
Native method stacks: For every thread, a separate native stack is created. It stores native method information.
