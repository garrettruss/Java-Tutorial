Garbage collection in Java is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management. Java programs compile to bytecode that can be run on a Java Virtual Machine, or JVM for short. When Java programs run on the JVM, objects are created on the heap, which is a portion of memory dedicated to the program. Eventually, some objects will no longer be needed. The garbage collector finds these unused objects and deletes them to free up memory.

The main objective of Garbage Collector is to free heap memory by destroying unreachable objects. The garbage collector is the best example of the Daemon thread as it is always running in the background. 

Java garbage collection is an automatic process. Automatic garbage collection is the process of looking at heap memory, identifying which objects are in use and which are not, and deleting the unused objects. An in-use object, or a referenced object, means that some part of your program still maintains a pointer to that object. An unused or unreferenced object is no longer referenced by any part of your program. So the memory used by an unreferenced object can be reclaimed. The programmer does not need to mark objects to be deleted explicitly. The garbage collection implementation lives in the JVM. 

Two types of garbage collection activity usually happen in Java. These are:

Minor or incremental Garbage Collection: It is said to have occurred when unreachable objects in the young generation heap memory are removed.
Major or Full Garbage Collection: It is said to have occurred when the objects that survived the minor garbage collection and copied into the old generation or permanent generation heap memory are removed. When compared to the young generation, garbage collection happens less frequently in the old generation/

Unreachable objects: An object is said to be unreachable if it doesnâ€™t contain any reference to it. Also, note that objects which are part of the island of isolation are also unreachable. 

2. Eligibility for garbage collection: An object is said to be eligible for GC(garbage collection) if it is unreachable. After i = null, integer object 4 in the heap area is suitable for garbage collection in the above image.

Ways to make an object eligible for Garbage Collector
Even though the programmer is not responsible for destroying useless objects but it is highly recommended to make an object unreachable(thus eligible for GC) if it is no longer required.
There are generally four ways to make an object eligible for garbage collection.
Nullifying the reference variable
Re-assigning the reference variable
An object created inside the method
Island of Isolation
