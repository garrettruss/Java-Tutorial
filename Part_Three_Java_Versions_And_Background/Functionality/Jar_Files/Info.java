A JAR (Java Archive) is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and resources (text, images, etc.) into one file to distribute application software or libraries on the Java platform. 
In simple words, a JAR file is a file that contains a compressed version of .class files, audio files, image files, or directories. We can imagine a .jar file as a zipped file(.zip) that is created by using WinZip software. Even, WinZip software can be used to extract the contents of a .jar . So you can use them for tasks such as lossless data compression, archiving, decompression, and archive unpacking.
