    Intro to Dijkstra's Algorithm: Conceptual
Now that we know how to properly search a graph, how can we use these skills in real life?

One of the most common applications of graph searches is to find the shortest distance between vertices. Finding this distance has a variety of applications such as finding the optimal route to a destination or transferring data in a computer network.

Take a look at the graph below. Finding the shortest path between vertex A and vertex E may seem easy in your brain, but telling a computer how to find it is a bit more complicated.


Fortunately, there is an algorithm that computes the shortest distance from a given vertex to the rest of the vertices in a graph. This is called Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm works as following:

Instantiate a dictionary that will eventually map vertices to their distance from the start vertex
Assign the start vertex a distance of 0 in a min heap
Assign every other vertex a distance of infinity in a min heap
Remove the vertex with the smallest distance from the min heap and set that to the current vertex
For the current vertex, consider all of its adjacent vertices and calculate the distance to them as (distance to the current vertex) + (edge weight of current vertex to adjacent vertex).
If this new distance is less than the current distance, replace the current distance.
Repeat 4 and 5 until the heap is empty
After the heap is empty, return the distances

We made it! Now that we have completed implementing Dijkstra’s algorithm, let’s recap all the steps that we took.

We first need to initialize the two objects that we would use to keep track of the shortest paths from the starting vertex to every vertex in the graph. The previous object keeps track of the preceding vertices in the path, like a reverse linked-list. We can use it to reconstruct the entire path, but backwards. The distances object keeps track of how far each vertex is from the starting vertex.

Before we can start traversing through the edges in the graph, we must initialize each vertex’s distance and previous vertex. When the dictionaries are initialized, we have not traversed down any paths to any of the vertices, so the initial distances should all be Infinity (and any actual paths are guaranteed to be less than the initial distance). When initializing the previous dictionary, previous vertices are all null. The only exception is the starting vertex where the distance from the starting vertex to itself is 0.

distances = {}
previous = {}

for every vertex in the graph:
   distances[vertex] = Infinity
   previous[vertex] = null

distances[starting vertex] = 0
Next, a priority queue is used to traverse through the graph. In order for a vertex to be queued, the path to that vertex must be smaller than what was previously recorded in distances. We can initially queue up the starting vertex because no other paths have been evaluated yet, so the “path” to itself is the shortest so far.

We continue to evaluate paths as long as there are vertices left in the queue. In order to evaluate new paths, we must dequeue a vertex from the queue and iterate through its neighbors. We then look at the distances to this vertex’s neighbors and the distance from the starting vertex to this vertex. The summation of these two distances is the full distance of the alternate path to the neighbor.

distances = {}
previous = {}
queue = priority queue

add starting vertex to queue

for every vertex in the graph:
   distances[vertex] = Infinity
   previous[vertex] = null

distances[starting vertex] = 0

while there are vertices in the queue:
   dequeue vertex from queue

   for every neighbor in vertex:
      alternate = distances[vertex] + distance from vertex to neighbor
Finally, we must compare the distance of the alternate path to the distance of the current path to the vertex. If the alternate path turns out to be shorter, then we want to ditch the current path and replace it with the alternate path. This means we will have to replace the neighbor’s previous vertex to the vertex, and the neighbor’s distance with the alternate distance.

With the discovery of a shorter path to the neighbor, it raises the possibility of shorter paths to other vertices in the graph through this path. To cover this case, we should add the neighbor to the queue so we can explore its connected vertices.

...
while there are vertices in the queue:
   dequeue vertex from queue

   for every neighbor in vertex:
      alternate = distances[vertex] + distance from vertex to neighbor

      if alternate < distances[neighbor]:
         distances[neighbor] = alternate
         previous[neighbor] = vertex
         add neighbor to queue
