/* 
Trees are an essential data structure for storing hierarchical data with a directed flow.

Similar to linked lists and graphs, trees are composed of nodes which hold data. The diagram represents nodes as rectangles and data as text.

Nodes also store references to zero or more other tree nodes. Data moves down from node to node. We depict those references as lines drawn between rectangles.

Trees are often displayed with a single node at the top and connected nodes branching downwards.

A company’s organization chart or a computer’s file directory are both real-world examples that can be represented as trees.

Trees grow downwards in computer science, and a root node is at the very top. The root of this tree is /photos.

/photos references to two other nodes: /safari and /wedding. /safari and /wedding are children or child nodes of /photos.

Conversely, /photos is a parent node because it has child nodes.

/safari and /wedding share the same parent node, which makes them siblings.

Note that the /safari node is child (to /photos) and parent (to lion.jpg and giraffe.jpg). It’s extremely common to have nodes act as both parent and child to different nodes within a tree.

When a node has no children, we refer to it as a leaf node.

Binary Search Tree
Constraints are placed on the data or node arrangement of a tree to solve difficult problems like efficient search.

A binary tree is a type of tree where each parent can have no more than two children, known as the left child and right child.

Further constraints make a binary search tree:

Left child values must be lesser than their parent.
Right child values must be greater than their parent.
The constraints of a binary search tree allow us to search the tree efficiently. At each node, we can discard half of the remaining possible values!

Introduction
Trees are wonderful data structures that can model real life hierarchical information, including organizational charts, genealogical trees, computer file systems, HTML elements on a web page also known as the Document Object Model (DOM), state diagrams, and more.

A tree is composed of tree nodes. There is a root tree node, and children tree nodes which may or may not be parent nodes themselves. In this lesson, we will first focus on building the TreeNode data structure. Then we’ll create the Tree.

A tree node is a very simple data structure that contains:

Data
A list of children, where each child is itself a tree node
(Optional) Pointer to a parent tree node, if there is a parent. Some implementations do this, but we won’t for this lesson.
We can add data to and remove data from a tree and traverse it in two different ways: depth-first or breadth-first.

Let’s first implement our tree node data structure as a TreeNode.
